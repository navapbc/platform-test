# Writing Tests

[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) is our test runner, which is simple but powerful. If you are new to pytest, reading up on how [fixtures work](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/fixtures.html) in particular might be helpful as it's one area that is a bit different than is common with other runners (and languages).

## Naming

pytest automatically discovers tests by [following a number of conventions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/goodpractices.html#conventions-for-python-test-discovery) (what it calls "collection").

For this project specifically:

- All tests live under `tests/`
- Under `tests/`, the organization mirrors the source code structure
  - The tests for `src/documentai_api/services/` are found at `tests/services/`
- Test files should begin with the `test_` prefix, followed by the module the tests cover, for example:
    - `utils/foo.py` will have tests in a file `tests/utils/test_foo_util.py`
    - `services/foo.py` will have tests in a file `tests/services/test_foo_service.py`
- Test cases should begin with the `test_` prefix, followed by the function it's testing and a description of what about the function it is testing, for example: 
    - `test_upload_file_success` tests the `upload_file` function's success case
    - `test_upload_file_failure` tests the `upload_file` function's failure case

There are occasions where tests may not line up exactly with a single source file, function, or otherwise may need to deviate from this exact structure, but this is the setup in general.

## Mocking AWS Services

Tests use [moto](https://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/) to mock AWS service calls, allowing tests to run without requiring actual AWS infrastructure.

Example mocking boto3 clients:

```python
import boto3
from moto import mock_aws

@mock_aws
def test_upload_file():
    s3 = boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
    bucket_name = "test-bucket"

    # Create the bucket in the mocked AWS environment
    s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)

    # Call your actual function
    upload_file(bucket_name, "test.txt", b"hello")

    # Verify the object exists
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key="test.txt")

    assert response["Body"].read() == b"hello"
```

## Testing API Endpoints

Use FastAPI's `TestClient` for testing API endpoints:

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from documentai_api.app import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_health_endpoint():
    response = client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "healthy"}
```

## Test Fixtures

Test fixtures provide reusable test data and setup. Place shared fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` or define them in individual test files.

Example fixture:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_pdf_bytes():
    return b"%PDF-1.4\n%\xE2\xE3\xCF\xD3\n..."

def test_document_processing(sample_pdf_bytes):
    # Use sample_pdf_bytes in test
    pass
```

## Coverage Requirements

- Target coverage: 85-95% (focus on testing important functionality through public APIs)
- Run `make test-coverage` to see coverage report
- Generate HTML report: `make test-coverage` (generates `.coverage_report/index.html`)

## Running Tests

- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make test-coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `make test-parallel` - Run tests in parallel
- `make test args=tests/path/test_file.py` - Run specific test file
- `make test args=tests/path/test_file.py::test_name` - Run specific test

See the [Testing section in the README](../../app-documentai/README.md#testing) for more details.
